    <div class="about__me_description">
      <p>Hi, I’m Alex Sklonin Front-end
        developer. I'm also actively involved in Web Design and UX / UI.</p>
      <p>
        Being organized, adaptive and detail-oriented, I tend to take on challenging projects.
        In my work, I use a human-centered design approach. I work “with”, not “for” my clients. When
        you succeed, I succeed!
        That's why I'm always committed to understand your requirements and communicate the progress of
        the projects to achieve perfect results.
      </p>
      <p>Ready to help you with implementation of interesting, fresh and global ideas that can bring
        something really good into our world.</p>

    <div class="about__exp_text">I've worked with many different clients and projects. Some projects were
      related to site layout. There I used my knowledge of <span>HTML5</span>, <span>CSS3</span> and such preprocessors like <span>SASS</span> and <span>Less</span>. Also,
      some projects were related to design, in which I used such tools as Figma, Photoshop and web design
